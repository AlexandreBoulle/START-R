# START-R project


## Requirements

We use Docker to develop and run START-R and START-R viewer. We invite you to ensure you have
installed the following requirements before trying to bootstrap the application:

* [Docker 1.12.6+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

> We recommend you to follow Docker's official documentations to install
required docker tools (see links above).

## Quick start

Have you read the "Requirements" section above?

### START R project installation

Download the zip file, extract this file and copy it where you want. If you move the folder, the installation procedure will have to be redone.

In this folder, you will find a file called INSTALLATION. By double clicking on it, the installation will begin. This may take a little time depending on your internet connection. When the installation was completed, two new files will appear. They allow to launch START-R analyzer and START-R viewer.

### START R analyzer utilisation
